Some resources relating to preparation for a graduate numerical linear algebra class.
</h2>
Numerical linear algebra, and more broadly numerical analysis, is equal parts a 
continuation of real analysis and practical implementation. It is hard for many since it 
is a blend of theorems, linear algebra, analysis, as well as problem solving and coding. 
Understanding and appreciating the nuances via numerical experimentation is essential.

<p>
Assuming a student is going to be taking a course based on <i>Numerical Linear Algebra</i>
by Trefethen and Bau (for example), here are some reasonable representative resources 
one could use to prepare:

<ul>
<li> From the linear algebra side, Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right; <a href="https://linear.axler.net/" target="_blank">link</a>; it's likely you can obtain digital copies through your university library or similar. 
The following are the minimal pieces necessary:
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1B, 1C,
<li>Chapter 2, 
<li>Chapter 3A-3C, 
<li>Chapter 5, 
<li>Chapter 6A, 6B, 
<li>7B, 7D* (for SVD)
</ul>

<li>From the analysis side, <a href="https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/athomas/FunctionalAnalysis/daners-functional-analysis-2017.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to Functional Analysis</a> by Daners (up to and including the chapter on Hilbert spaces)

<li>If you want a single book, or prefer inexpensive physical books, I'm a fan of books by Georgi Shilov;
<ul>
<li>"Linear Algebra" by Shilov is similar but doesn't get into the analysis as much.
<li>"Elementary Functional Analysis" by Shilov is the most abstract (after a hundred pages of theory, the following section applies this to find the "usual" solutions linear n-th order differential equations)
<li>"An introduction to the theory of linear spaces" by Shilov is in the Goldilocks zone, covering a little bit of everything. A digital copy exists on archive.org if you make a free account; <a href="https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000shil/page/n9/mode/2up">link</a> (current as of 3 August 2023); otherwise you might have to interlibrary loan or buy if you want a physical copy.
</ul>
<li>A very brief intro to the essentials of asymptotics by Senning: <a href="https://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/ma342/handouts/rate.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>
<li>Programming: Hard to point at a specific resource. But the necessary skills are:
<ul>
<li>for loops, while loops, etc. 
<li>knowing how to make functions, 
<li>run parameter sweeps, 
<li>make loglog plots to study convergence, 
<li>make plots of matrices (the "spy" or "matshow" command in matlab or pyplot), 
<li>understanding of data types and how to work with vectors/matrices/arrays.
<li>A thing to get your feet wet in a lot of this is to produce plots studying different methods for rootfinding (studying how to solve f(x)=0 for arbitrary function f) &mdash; Newton's method, bisection, secant, false position method. 
</ul>
<li>Yes, these topics have overlap.
